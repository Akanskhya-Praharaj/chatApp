Real-Time Chat App (MERN + Socket.IO)
This is a full-stack real-time chat application built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN stack). 
It uses Socket.IO to enable real-time communication, so users can send and receive messages instantly without reloading the page.
The app includes user authentication, a clean and responsive UI, and secure backend APIs. All messages are stored in MongoDB, and Socket.IO handles the live messaging between users.

Features:
Real-time messaging with Socket.IO
JWT-based authentication (Login/Register)
MongoDB for storing users and messages
Responsive React UI
RESTful API with Express and Node.js


This project is ideal for learning how real-time apps work using modern web technologies.
